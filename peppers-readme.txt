Glossary
Heat
Mild, Medium, Hot, Extra-Hot, or Super-Hot. We break them down by color (green, yellow, light orange, dark orange, red). This is the simplest way to explore our hot pepper list and get an idea of where things sit. Note that “Medium” is plenty hot here. It contains the likes of jalapeños and cayenne peppers, which many with milder tastes find very spicy.

SHU
Scoville heat units. The units by which the Scoville scale is measured (read more about them here). It is the key numerical value of our (or any) hot pepper list.

Min/Max SHU
Even individual hot peppers have a range of heat, depending on where they are grown, how long they’ve matured, and even the amount of sun they’ve received. The minimum SHU is the mildest a pepper could be; the maximum SHU is the hottest possible for the variety.

Median SHU
The number exactly in the middle between the minimum and maximum Scoville heat units of the pepper. This gives us one number by which to compare our jalapeño reference point.

JalRP
Jalapeño reference point. Our hot pepper list gives you a perspective of how hot these peppers really are by comparing them against a reference point most everyone has tried. We offer this data in two ways:

Decimal: Based on the median heat of the peppers. The jalapeno is “1,” and the other peppers are either less than one (less spicy) or above one (hotter). As you’ll see, some peppers are much, much hotter than a jalapeño. You can read the hotter pepper numbers as “X times hotter than a jalapeño”. For instance, the median heat of a habanero (at 42.86) is nearly 43 times hotter than the median heat of a jalapeño.
Range: Based on the minimum and maximum SHUs of the pepper. We offer this option in the Fast Facts pop-up. It shows how the range of potential times hotter/milder given each chili has a range of heat.
Origin
Where the chili pepper has its roots. All chili peppers are native to South and Central America, but here we consider “origin” as where the pepper is now regionally connected or primarily cultivated.
